# Table of contents

**1. Biometrics evaluation**. This assignment focuses on evaluating the performance of any biometric system in (a) a verification setting, and (b) an identification setting.

*Basic concepts:* score distributions, FAR/FPR, FRR/FNR, recall, precision, Equal Error Rate (EER), ROC curves, Detection Error Trade-off (DET) curves, Precision-Recall (PR) curves, F1-score, ROC Area Under Curve (AUC), Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) curves, Rank-1 Recognition Rate

**2. Fingerprint and iris identification**. This assignment consists of implementing and testing a keypoint-based fingerprint and iris recognition biometric system, and finally fuse those two systems together to create a multimodal biometric system.

*Basic concepts:* similarity functions, similarity/matching scores, distance-based metrics, knee plots, local/global/hybrid features, keypoint detectors and descriptors, ORB/SIFT/SURF algorithms, authentication

**3. Face recognition**. This assignment consists of implementing and testing a face recognition system based on Principal Components Analysis (Eigenfaces), Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisherfaces), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and deep learning. The first three procedures are representative of old-school computer vision techniques that are still in use and retain their merits. All four generated feature vector descriptors can be compared for verification/identification.

*Basic concepts:* distance-based pairwise matching scores, verification assessment (F1-score, accuracy, EER, FAR-FRR curve, PR curve, CMC curve), fine-tuning comparison
